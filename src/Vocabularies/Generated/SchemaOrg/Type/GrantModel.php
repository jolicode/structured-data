    sometimes not necessarily via a dedicated or long-lived [[Project]], resulting in one or more outputs, or [[fundedItem]]s. For financial sponsorship, indicate the [[funder]] of a [[MonetaryGrant]]. For non-financial support, indicate [[sponsor]] of [[Grant]]s of resources (e.g. office space).

Grants support  activities directed towards some agreed collective goals, often but not always organized as [[Project]]s. Long-lived projects are sometimes sponsored by a variety of grants over time, but it is also common for a project to be associated with a single grant.

The amount of a [[Grant]] is represented using [[amount]] as a [[MonetaryAmount]].';
